> **Forma** is a premium, intent-driven browser extension designed to eliminate the friction of campus placement drives. It works on **Google Forms, Microsoft Forms, Greenhouse, Lever, Workday**, and any standard HTML form. Built for students at institutions like **Chandigarh University (CU)**, it replaces tedious data entry with a "cozy," single-click experience that values accuracy and privacy above all else.

## 📸 Experience Walkthrough


### Universal Semantic Parser
Forma doesn't just work on Google Forms — it works **everywhere**.
- **W3C Accessibility Labels:** Reads `aria-labelledby`, `<label for>`, and implicit `<label>` wrapping.
- **Heading Fallback:** For stubborn platforms like Microsoft Forms, it walks up the DOM to find question headings.
- **SPA-Aware:** Uses a MutationObserver to wait for React/Angular-rendered inputs before parsing.

### Smart Matching Engine
Forma doesn't just look for exact labels; it understands **intent**.
- **Keyword Matching:** Handles direct hits like "First Name" or "UID."
- **Fuzzy Search:** Powered by **Fuse.js**, it handles typos and synonyms like "Enrollment Number" vs "Roll No."
- **Structural Analysis:** Intelligently detects constraints like "without country code" or "10-digit number."

### Adaptive Learning
When you manually correct a field, Forma notices. It performs a **reverse-lookup** into your profile and asks if it should remember that specific mapping for every future form you encounter.

### The "Cozy Organic" Interface
Forma moves away from sterile, boxy AI designs. The popup and options pages use a **warm, earthy palette** and a unique **plaque-style design** that feels tactile and approachable.
